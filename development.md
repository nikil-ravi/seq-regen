TODOS:

- use bert-base-uncased to predict masks from masked out sequence
    - regenerate for k iterations, plot graph of accuracy or other metric
- run inference using https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking-finetuned-squad
    on SquAD dataset
        - first reproduce original f1 score
        - then do regeneration and see what f1 score is
